# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This repository is intentionally small and Docker-centric.

- `Dockerfile`: Builds the `claude` CLI image on Ubuntu.
- `compose.yml`: Local runtime defaults (container name, mount, env wiring, entrypoint).
- `README.md`: Primary usage documentation.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: CI/CD orchestration (lint/scan, build/push, Dependabot auto-merge).
- `.github/dependabot.yml` and `.github/renovate.json`: dependency update automation.

Keep new files at the repo root unless they are CI/config artifacts (`.github/...`).

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

Use Docker Compose for all local workflows:

- `docker compose build` builds the `claude-code` image from `Dockerfile`.
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... docker compose run --rm claude-code` starts an interactive CLI session.
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... docker compose run --rm claude-code -p "explain this project"` runs a one-shot prompt.
- `HOST_WORK_DIR=/path/to/project ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... docker compose run --rm claude-code` mounts a different workspace.

Before opening a PR, at minimum run a fresh build and one container smoke test.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- YAML uses 2-space indentation and lowercase keys.
- Dockerfile instructions are uppercase (`FROM`, `RUN`, `ENV`) with grouped, multi-line `RUN` blocks.
- Prefer explicit shell safety (`bash -euo pipefail`) and deterministic install steps.
- Keep filenames lowercase (`compose.yml`, `ci.yml`) and use descriptive, tool-oriented names.

## Testing Guidelines

There is no unit-test framework in this repo. Validation is operational:

- Local: build + run smoke test commands above.
- CI: `docker-lint-and-scan` plus build/scan jobs on pushes and pull requests to `main`.

If behavior changes, include exact verification commands and outcomes in the PR description.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Follow the existing history’s style: concise, imperative, sentence-case summaries (example: `Add Docker setup and comprehensive documentation for Claude Code`).

PRs should include:

- What changed and why.
- Any related issue link.
- Local validation commands executed.
- Screenshots only when UI/output clarity benefits from them.

## Security & Configuration Tips

Never commit API keys or tokens. Provide secrets via environment variables at runtime. Keep `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and other provider credentials local-only.
